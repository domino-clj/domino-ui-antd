This is\n  probably only useful in a development environment, when you want to\n  update components in response to some dynamic changes to code.\n\n  Note that force-update-all may not update root components. This\n  happens if a component 'foo' is mounted with `(render [foo])` (since\n  functions are passed by value, and not by reference, in\n  ClojureScript). To get around this you'll have to introduce a layer\n  of indirection, for example by using `(render [#'foo])` instead.\"\n  []\n  (ratom/flush!)\n  (dom/force-update-all)\n  (batch/flush-after-render))\n\n(defn create-class\n  \"Creates JS class based on provided Clojure map, for example:\n\n  ```cljs\n  {;; Constructor\n   :constructor (fn [this props])\n   :get-initial-state (fn [this])\n   ;; Static methods\n   :get-derived-state-from-props (fn [props state] partial-state)\n   :get-derived-state-from-error (fn [error] partial-state)\n   ;; Methods\n   :get-snapshot-before-update (fn [this old-argv new-argv] snapshot)\n   :should-component-update (fn [this old-argv new-argv])\n   :component-did-mount (fn [this])\n   :component-did-update (fn [this old-argv old-state snapshot])\n   :component-will-unmount (fn [this])\n   :component-did-catch (fn [this error info])\n   :reagent-render (fn [args....])\n   ;; Or alternatively:\n   :render (fn [this])\n   ;; Deprecated methods:\n   :UNSAFE_component-will-receive-props (fn [this new-argv])\n   :UNSAFE_component-will-update (fn [this new-argv new-state])\n   :UNSAFE_component-will-mount (fn [this])}\n  ```\n\n  Everything is optional, except either :reagent-render or :render.\n\n  Map keys should use `React.Component` method names (https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html),\n  and can be provided in snake-case or camelCase.\n\n  State can be initialized using constructor, which matches React.Component class,\n  or using getInitialState which matches old React createClass function and is\n  now implemented by Reagent for compatibility.\n\n  State can usually be anything, e.g. Cljs object.
