a queue for processing.\n;; A short time later, the handler registered to handle this event will be run.\n;; What follows is the implementation of this process.\n;;\n;; The task is to process queued events in a perpetual loop, one after\n;; the other, FIFO, calling the registered event-handler for each, being idle when\n;; there are no events, and firing up when one arrives.\n;;\n;; But browsers only have a single thread of control and we must be\n;; careful to not hog the CPU. When processing events one after another, we\n;; must regularly hand back control to the browser, so it can redraw, process\n;; websockets, etc. But not too regularly! If we are in a de-focused browser\n;; tab, our app will be CPU throttled. Each time we get back control, we have\n;; to process all queued events, or else something like a bursty websocket\n;; (producing events) might overwhelm the queue. So there's a balance.\n;;\n;; The processing/handling of an event happens \"asynchronously\" sometime after\n;; that event was enqueued via \"dispatch\". The original implementation of this router loop\n;; used `core.async`. As a result, it was fairly simple, and it mostly worked,\n;; but it did not give enough control. So now we hand-roll our own,\n;; finite-state-machine and all.\n;;\n;; In what follows, the strategy is this:\n;;   - maintain a FIFO queue of `dispatched` events.\n;;   - when a new event arrives, \"schedule\" processing of this queue using\n;;     goog.async.nextTick, which means it will happen \"very soon\".\n;;   - when processing events, one after the other, do ALL the currently\n;;     queued events. Don't stop. Don't yield to the browser. Hog that CPU.\n;;   - but if any new events are dispatched during this cycle of processing,\n;;     don't do them immediately. Leave them queued. Yield first to the browser,\n;;     and do these new events in the next processing cycle. That way we drain\n;;     the queue up to a point, but we never hog the CPU forever. In\n;;     particular, we handle the case where handling one event will beget\n;;     another event. The freshly begotten event will be handled next cycle,\n;;     with yielding in-between.\n;;   - In some cases, an event should not be handled until after the GUI has been\n;;     updated, i.e., after the next Reagent animation frame.
